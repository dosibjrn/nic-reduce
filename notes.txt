Below is an example repository structure for a Flutter web app MVP, including:

All Flutter code (MVP-level)
Unit tests for the core logic
Bash scripts (runnable on Windows Git Bash) to help set up and deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
Placeholder secrets file (so you can keep sensitive data out of version control)
Instructions on how to run tests, build the web app, and deploy to Azure
Disclaimer: The Azure CLI commands and scripts below illustrate a possible setup. Adjust naming (e.g., resource group name, static web app name, region) to fit your Azure subscription and environment.



6. Running the App for Web
Install the FlutterFire CLI (if not done):
bash
Copy code
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
This step generates/updates firebase_options.dart.
Enable web:
bash
Copy code
flutter config --enable-web
flutter doctor
Get packages:
bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the app on web:
bash
Copy code
flutter run -d chrome
Build for release:
bash
Copy code
flutter build web
Then deploy build/web to your hosting (e.g., Azure Static Web Apps, Firebase Hosting, etc.).
7. Summary
Google Sign-In is handled via FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithPopup(googleProvider) on the web.
Firestore is used to store each user’s data in a document named by their uid.
The MVP logic (daily reduction, next dose scheduling) remains the same—just replaced the local SharedPreferences storage with Firestore.
We included a “Delete My Data” (basic GDPR) step in settings. Full compliance might require export features, detailed logs, etc.
This approach scales to other providers (Apple, Facebook, Microsoft) by adding them to Firebase Auth’s sign-in methods.
This code should provide a complete, expanded MVP that runs on Flutter Web with Google Sign-In for user accounts and Firestore for data persistence.
